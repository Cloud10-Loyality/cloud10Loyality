Regarding the LMS project, we have completed the below modules:

Integration Module:

 

An API is created to integrate all the hotels' data with the Loyalty Management System. This module allows hotels to pass their data in the request for integration.

 

Token Creation:

Token creation, as well as minting and burning of tokens, is implemented through REST API.

 

Gateway Services:

A service named Gateway is built, which captures all the hotel reservations and notifies customers about their loyalty points.

 

Admin Panel UI mock-up:

As part of the admin panel, we have covered

·      Home Page

·      Admin Dashboard  

·      Provider setup details

·      Reward marketplace details
